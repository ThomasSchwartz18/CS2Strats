            <h3>Anti-Eco Round</h3>
            <p>You’re playing against opponents who likely have little to no armor and weaker weapons, such as pistols or SMGs. 
                The primary goal is to minimize risk, maintain your economy, and avoid giving away any weapons to the enemy.

            <h3>Force Buy Round</h3>
            <p>Force buys are rounds where your team spends most of its remaining money on weapons, armor, and utility, despite not having enough for a full buy. 
                The goal in a force buy is to make the most of what you have and try to secure a round win or at least do economic damage to the enemy.

                These rounds are often the most tactical and crucial in a match, as both teams have all the resources needed to execute complex strategies.

            <h4>Pistol Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Fast B Rush</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Overwhelm the B site quickly before the CTs can set up their defenses.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players rush B through banana, using flashbangs to blind any CTs holding close or on site.</li>
                <li>Push onto the site, focusing on clearing new box, coffins, and dark. Plant the bomb and set up post-plant positions in banana, site, and new box.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A fast B rush can catch the CTs off guard, especially if they haven’t fully rotated or set up their utility.</p>
        
            <h5>A Split (Arch and Short)</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Split the A site by attacking from both arch (long) and short.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players up mid and two through apartments.</li>
                <li>The mid players should smoke off arch or library and push through short, while the apartment players clear pit and balcony.</li>
                <li>Focus on trading kills and taking control of the A site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting the A site from multiple directions divides the CTs’ attention, making it harder for them to hold the site effectively.</p>
        
            <h5>Apartment Pop</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Surprise the CTs by rushing out of apartments onto A site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send all five players into apartments quietly.</li>
                <li>On a coordinated call, rush out of apartments through balcony, using a flashbang or two to blind any CTs holding pit or site.</li>
                <li>Focus on overwhelming the pit player and planting the bomb quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The apartment pop can catch CTs off guard, especially if they’re not expecting a fast push from this angle.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid to force the CTs to rotate or give up map control.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send four players up mid with one holding banana for a potential B split.</li>
                <li>Use utility to smoke off arch and molotov positions like boiler and cubby.</li>
                <li>Once mid control is secured, decide whether to split A or rotate to B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid forces the CTs to react, either by rotating or giving up key positions.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="pistol-ct-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">
            <h4>Pistol Round - CT_Side</h4>
        
            <h5>Standard 3-1-1 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain control of all map areas with a balanced defense.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play three players on A (one holding long, one short, one pit), one mid, and one on B.</li>
                <li>The A players focus on delaying any push while the B player holds banana with utility to slow down a rush.</li>
                <li>The mid player should assist B or A as needed, depending on where the Ts are attacking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> This setup provides solid coverage and allows for quick rotations based on T-side movements.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Banana Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of banana early to deny the Ts access to B.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two or three players to banana with utility (HE grenades, molotovs, flashes) to take control of the area.</li>
                <li>One player holds close while the other falls back to site or coffins after securing banana control.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Aggressive banana control can deny the Ts easy access to B and force them to commit more resources if they want to contest it.</p>
        
            <h5>A Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate an A push and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack four players on A (one long, one short, one pit, one apps) with one player on B.</li>
                <li>The A players should use utility to delay any push and hold strong positions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A stacks are effective when you expect the Ts to favor the A site, allowing you to overwhelm them with superior numbers.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B rush and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on B (one banana, one site, one coffins) with two players holding A.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay any rush and hold close angles where pistols excel.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B stacks can shut down a T-side B rush, especially if the Ts are not expecting a heavy defense.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid early to prevent the Ts from executing their strategy.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to push mid with utility to take control, while one holds boiler or apartments.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashes to blind the Ts and take control of mid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Aggressive mid control can catch the Ts off guard and deny them an important part of the map.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="anti-eco-t-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">
            <h4>Anti-Eco Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Group and Push Together (A or B)</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use superior firepower to overwhelm a bombsite.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>B Push:</strong> All five players group up and push banana together, using utility to clear angles and force the CTs back. Once the site is secured, plant the bomb and hold post-plant positions.</li>
                <li><strong>A Push:</strong> Similarly, all five players push up mid and split A through short and long, using flashbangs to blind any CTs holding close.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Grouping up reduces the chances of being picked off individually and allows for effective trading.</p>
        
            <h5>Slow Play with Map Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of key areas slowly to avoid ambushes.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to banana, one mid, and two to apps.</li>
                <li>Carefully clear out common stack spots using utility, such as molotovs for cubby and pit.</li>
                <li>Once you’ve gathered information on the CT setup, execute onto the weaker site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Slow, methodical play helps avoid walking into eco traps and allows you to react based on the CT setup.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Control mid to cut off rotations and split towards a bombsite.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take control of mid with three players, while two players hold banana or apps.</li>
                <li>Once mid control is secured, split towards the weaker site, either through arch to B or short to A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid on Inferno gives you options to execute onto either site while cutting off CT rotations.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake B, Hit A</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CT rotations away from A and execute onto A.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to make noise at banana with utility, while three players hold mid.</li>
                <li>After selling the fake, the B players fall back and the team pushes A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A well-executed fake can draw defenders away from the actual target, making it easier to secure the site.</p>
        
            <h5>Anti-Stack Play</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Avoid potential CT stacks and maintain a strong economy.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread out across the map and play cautiously.</li>
                <li>Use utility to clear common stack spots and probe for information.</li>
                <li>If a stack is detected, rotate to the other site or play for picks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Avoiding a stack minimizes the risk of losing multiple players to a pistol eco and ensures a safer round.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="anti-eco-ct-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">     
            <h4>Anti-Eco Round - CT_Side</h4>
        
            <h5>Standard 3-1-1 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain control of the map while minimizing risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play three players on A, one mid, and one on B.</li>
                <li>Hold angles from a distance where rifles and SMGs can engage pistols at a safe range.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay pushes and gather information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A standard setup gives you good coverage while avoiding over-extending into potential pistol pushes.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Banana Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of banana to deny the Ts easy access to B.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to banana with utility to control the area.</li>
                <li>One player holds close while the other falls back to site after securing control.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Aggressive banana control can deny the Ts easy access to B and force them to commit more resources if they want to contest it.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack with Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B push and reinforce the site while maintaining mid control.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on B (one banana, one site, one coffins) with two on A.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay any push and hold strong angles where rifles can shine.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B stacks can completely shut down a T-side rush, especially with mid control cutting off rotations.</p>
        
            <h5>A Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate an A hit and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack four players on A (one pit, one short, one long, one apps) with one player on B.</li>
                <li>Use smokes to block vision and flashbangs to blind any Ts pushing A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> If the Ts commit to A, your stack can overwhelm them with superior firepower and numbers.</p>
        
            <h5>Push for Early Information</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain early map control and gather information about the T setup.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Push two players into banana or mid to gather early information.</li>
                <li>If you encounter resistance, fall back and adjust your defense accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Gaining early information allows you to adapt your defense and potentially catch the Ts off guard.</p>

        <div id="force-buy-t-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">
            <h4>Force Buy Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>B Rush with Tech-9s/MAC-10s</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use close-range weapons to overwhelm the B site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players rush banana with Tech-9s, MAC-10s, or shotguns.</li>
                <li>Use flashbangs to blind any CTs holding banana or site and push aggressively.</li>
                <li>Once you secure the site, smoke off CT and coffins, and plant the bomb.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B site on Inferno has tight corners, making it ideal for close-range weapons in a fast rush.</p>
        
            <h5>Apts Pop</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Rush apartments and take control of the A site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols (Deagles, P250s) and some utility (smokes, flashes).</li>
                <li>Send four players into apartments with one holding mid for any pushes.</li>
                <li>On a coordinated call, rush out of apartments through balcony, using a flashbang or two to blind any CTs holding pit or site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A quick pop out of apartments can overwhelm the A site defenders, especially if they’re not expecting a fast push.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to B Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Split the B site from two directions, overwhelming the defenders.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to banana and three players to mid.</li>
                <li>Smoke off CT and flash through mid to take control.</li>
                <li>The mid players push through arch to B, while the banana players execute onto the site simultaneously.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The split attack divides the attention of the CTs and can overwhelm the B defenders.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control with a Lurk</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Control mid and create an opening for a site hit.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols or SMGs and send three players to take mid control, while one player lurks at B and the other at A.</li>
                <li>Use utility to smoke off key areas like arch and molotov common positions.</li>
                <li>After taking mid control, the lurkers can apply pressure to the sites, making it easier to decide where to execute.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Mid control gives you options to hit either site and forces the CTs to spread out, making it easier to find openings.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake B, Hit A</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CTs away from A and hit it with force.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players with SMGs or pistols to banana to make noise and throw utility.</li>
                <li>The remaining three players wait near mid and apartments.</li>
                <li>After the fake, regroup and hit A, taking advantage of any rotations the CTs might have made.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The fake can cause the CTs to over-rotate, leaving A more vulnerable to a force buy push.</p>

            <h4>Force Buy Round - CT_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Aggressive Banana Push</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain control of banana and potentially get early picks.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols or SMGs and send two or three players to push banana aggressively.</li>
                <li>Use flashes to blind any Ts holding banana or top mid.</li>
                <li>After securing banana control, either fall back to site or continue to apply pressure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> An aggressive banana push can catch the Ts off guard and deny them control of a critical area.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid early and deny the Ts access.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols or SMGs and send two players to mid with utility to take control.</li>
                <li>One player holds long while the other watches short or boiler.</li>
                <li>The remaining players hold B and A passively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Mid control on Inferno is crucial and can prevent the Ts from executing their strategies effectively.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B rush and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three or four players on B with pistols and utility.</li>
                <li>Play close angles on banana and site.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashbangs to delay the push and engage the Ts at close range.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B rushes are common in force buys, and stacking the site with close-range weapons can shut down the T-side's push.</p>
        
            <h5>A Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate an A push and overwhelm the Ts with numbers.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three or four players on A site, with two holding apartments and the others in pit or short.</li>
                <li>Use utility to block vision and flashbangs to blind any Ts pushing A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> If the Ts commit to A, your stack can overwhelm them with superior numbers and close-range weapons.</p>
        
            <h5>Early Information Push</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain early map control and gather information about the T setup.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Push two players into banana or mid to gather early information.</li>
                <li>If you encounter resistance, fall back and adjust your defense accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Gaining early information allows you to adapt your defense and potentially catch the Ts off guard.</p>

            <h4>Full Buy Round - T_Side Strategies</h4>
            
            <h5>Default Spread</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain map control, gather information, and adapt based on the CT setup.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to banana, one to mid, and two to apartments.</li>
                <li>The banana players should take control using utility, while the mid player looks for aggression and the apartments players clear out any CTs holding positions.</li>
                <li>After gathering information, decide whether to execute on A, B, or mid, depending on where the CTs are weakest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A default spread allows you to control key areas of the map while being flexible enough to react to the CT’s movements.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to B Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Split the B site from two directions, overwhelming the defenders.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with two players at banana and three players taking mid control.</li>
                <li>Smoke off CT and use flashes to push through arch or long.</li>
                <li>The mid players push through to B, while the banana players execute onto the site simultaneously.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting B divides the attention of the CTs, making it harder for them to defend against a coordinated push.</p>
        
            <h5>Apts Control into A Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of apartments and split the A site with players coming from short.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to apartments and three to mid.</li>
                <li>The apartments players use utility (smokes, flashes) to take control of apartments and force CTs back.</li>
                <li>The mid players take control and push through short to split onto A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting the A site from apartments and short forces the CTs to defend from multiple angles, making it difficult for them to hold the site.</p>
        
            <h5>B Execute</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Overwhelm the B site with a coordinated execute.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players set up for a B execute, using smokes, flashes, and molotovs to clear out key positions.</li>
                <li>Smoke off CT and coffins, and use molotovs to flush out any CTs hiding in common spots.</li>
                <li>Push onto the site and plant the bomb.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A well-executed B hit with proper utility can overwhelm the B defenders, especially if they’re not expecting a fast-paced attack.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake A, Hit B</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CTs away from B and hit it with force.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to apartments and short to make noise and throw utility, simulating an A hit.</li>
                <li>The other two players wait near banana.</li>
                <li>After the fake, the A players fall back, and the entire team hits B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A fake can cause the CTs to over-rotate, leaving B under-defended.</p>

            <h4>Full Buy Round - CT_Side Strategies</h4>
            
            <h5>Standard 3-1-1 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain balanced control of the map with the ability to rotate quickly.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play three players on A, one mid, and one on B.</li>
                <li>The A players should control short, long, and pit, while the mid player controls rotations and assists A or B as needed, and the B player holds banana.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A standard setup allows for good map control and the ability to rotate quickly based on where the T-side decides to push.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Banana Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of banana early to deny the T-side access to key areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to aggressively control banana, with one holding mid and two holding A.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashes to block vision and engage the Ts in banana.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling banana on Inferno is crucial, as it denies the Ts access to critical parts of the map and forces them into more predictable paths.</p>
        
            <h5>A Site Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of apartments and short early to deny the T-side access to the A site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to control apartments and one player to control short.</li>
                <li>Use utility (smokes, molotovs) to block key areas like boiler, pit, and balcony.</li>
                <li>The remaining players hold mid and B passively, ready to rotate if needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling apartments and short gives you a strong defensive position and denies the T-side a crucial entry point to the A site.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack with Banana Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B push and reinforce the site while maintaining banana control.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play three players on B (one banana, one site, one coffins) and two on A.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay any push and hold close angles on B site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B stacks can completely shut down a T-side B rush, especially with banana control cutting off rotations.</p>
        
            <h5>Double AWP Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use AWPs to control long-range engagements and deny the T-side key areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>One AWP player holds mid, peeking from arch or short to pick off any Ts trying to take control.</li>
                <li>The second AWP holds banana or B site, focusing on picking any T-side players trying to push banana or B site.</li>
                <li>The remaining players hold A site and B site, using utility to support the AWPers and deny map control.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Double AWP setups can be incredibly powerful on Inferno, where long-range sightlines dominate, allowing you to control key areas of the map and force the T-side into difficult engagements.</p>
