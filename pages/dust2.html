            <h3>Pistol Round</h3>
            <p>The key to success is communication, coordination, and adapting based on the enemy team's tendencies and your own team's strengths.</p>

            <h3>Anti-Eco Round</h3>
            <p> Youâ€™re playing against opponents who likely have little to no armor and weaker weapons, such as pistols or SMGs. 
                The primary goal is to minimize risk, maintain your economy, and avoid giving away any weapons to the enemy.

            <h3>Force Buy Round</h3>
            <p>Force buys are rounds where your team spends most of its remaining money on weapons, armor, and utility, despite not having enough for a full buy. 
                The goal in a force buy is to make the most of what you have and try to secure a round win or at least do economic damage to the enemy.

            <h3>Full Buy Round</h3>
            <p>Full buy rounds are where both teams are fully equipped with rifles (usually AK-47s for Ts and M4s for CTs), full armor, and utility (smokes, flashes, molotovs, and HE grenades). 
                These rounds are often the most tactical and crucial in a match, as both teams have all the resources needed to execute complex strategies.

            <h4>Pistol Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Fast A Long Push</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Overwhelm the A long defense with numbers.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players rush A long from T spawn.</li>
                <li>Use flashbangs to blind any CTs peeking from pit or corner.</li>
                <li>If you win the long fight, immediately push up long towards A site.</li>
                <li>Smoke off CT spawn, or have a player watch it while the rest push up ramp and plant for long.</li>
                <li>After planting, fall back to long or hold post-plant positions on site and ramp.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> On pistol rounds, it's common for CTs to play only one or two players on A long. Rushing with all five can quickly overwhelm them, especially with well-timed flashes.</p>
        
            <h5>Split A (Catwalk and Long)</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Divide the CTs' attention and split the A site from two directions.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players up catwalk (short) and two players towards A long.</li>
                <li>The catwalk players should use a smoke to cover cross to A site and flash over as they push up.</li>
                <li>The long players should push simultaneously, using flashes to blind any CTs holding pit or ramp.</li>
                <li>This pincer attack from both catwalk and long can overwhelm the CTs holding A site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting the A site divides the CTs' focus, making it harder for them to defend effectively.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to B Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of the B site by attacking it from mid and tunnels.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have two players go through lower tunnels to B, and three players push mid.</li>
                <li>Smoke off CT spawn from mid to block vision, and use flashes to take control of mid.</li>
                <li>The mid players should push through doors to B, while the tunnel players execute from the tunnels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B site is usually held by one or two players, and splitting it from two angles makes it difficult for the CTs to defend effectively.</p>
        
            <h5>B Rush</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Overwhelm the B site with speed.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players rush B tunnels.</li>
                <li>Use flashbangs to blind any CTs peeking from B site or window.</li>
                <li>Push into B quickly and overwhelm the defenders.</li>
                <li>Plant the bomb and set up strong post-plant positions (site, tunnels, window).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> On pistol rounds, CTs often play 1-2 players on B. A fast rush can overwhelm them before they have time to rotate.</p>
        
            <h5>Decoy Fake</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Fake an attack to draw rotations, then hit the opposite site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy decoys and throw them towards A long or B tunnels to mimic an aggressive push.</li>
                <li>Immediately after throwing decoys, quietly regroup and execute on the opposite site.</li>
                <li>The decoys can cause the CTs to over-rotate, leaving the site you're actually hitting under-defended.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Decoys can be used to trick the CTs into thinking you're rushing one site, allowing you to attack the other with fewer defenders.</p>

            <h4>Pistol Round - CT_Side</h4>
        
            <h5>Standard 2-1-2 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Cover all areas of the map with balanced defense.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two players hold A (one long, one short/catwalk).</li>
                <li>One player anchors mid, ready to assist B or A.</li>
                <li>Two players hold B (one site, one mid/CT).</li>
                <li>The A long player should have a flash ready to support a push, while the catwalk player holds from car or ramp.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> This setup ensures coverage across the map and allows for quick rotations, depending on where the T-side attacks.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid to prevent a split or rush.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two players push mid aggressively from CT spawn, with one holding from doors and the other from Xbox.</li>
                <li>One player holds A long, and two players anchor B (with one ready to rotate mid).</li>
                <li>Use flashes to blind T players peeking mid, and gain early control of the area.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid denies the T-side easy access to split A or B, and it allows for quick rotations to either site.</p>
        
            <h5>Heavy A Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate and counter an A push, especially long.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on A (two long, one short), with one player on mid and one on B.</li>
                <li>The long players should aggressively take control of long with flashes and possibly a HE grenade.</li>
                <li>The short player holds catwalk from ramp or site.</li>
                <li>If long is secured, the mid player can rotate to A or assist B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Pistol rounds often involve T-side pushes on long A. A heavy stack can catch them off guard and secure early kills.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate and counter a B rush.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on B (two in site, one in tunnels), with one mid and one A.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashes to delay any rush and force the Ts into a tough entry.</li>
                <li>The tunnels player should play close and be ready to trade if necessary.</li>
                <li>The mid player can assist B or rotate to A if the push comes from there.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B rushes are common on pistol rounds, and a well-timed stack can completely shut down the T-sideâ€™s plan.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to B Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Be ready to counter a mid to B split or a B rush.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack two players in B and one player in mid, with two players holding A (one long, one short).</li>
                <li>The mid player should be ready to drop into CT spawn to help B or rotate to A as needed.</li>
                <li>If the T-side attempts a mid to B split, the mid player can hold them off long enough for the B players to secure the site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> This setup counters both B rushes and mid to B splits, which are common pistol round strategies for the T-side.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="anti-eco-t-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">
            <button href="#" onclick="showSidePage('anti-eco-t-side')">T_Side</button>
            <button href="#" onclick="showSidePage('anti-eco-ct-side')">CT_Side</button>
            <h4>Anti-Eco Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Group and Push Together (A Long or B Rush)</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use superior firepower and numbers to overwhelm a single bombsite.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Long:</strong> All five players push A long together, using utility (flashbangs, smokes) to clear angles and force the CTs back. Once youâ€™ve taken control of long, execute onto the A site with a smoke for CT spawn and a molotov for goose. Plant the bomb and hold post-plant positions from long and site/ramp.</li>
                <li><strong>B Rush:</strong> Similar to A long, all five players rush B together through tunnels. Use flashbangs to blind any close CTs and quickly take control of the site. Smoke the doors and molotov window to secure the site and prevent a retake.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> By grouping up and pushing a site together, you reduce the chances of being picked off individually by pistols and ensure that your superior weapons can trade effectively.</p>
        
            <h5>Slow Play with Map Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take map control cautiously to avoid ambushes, then execute on the weaker site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players towards A long, one towards mid, and two towards B tunnels. Take control of key areas slowly, using utility to clear common hiding spots (e.g., pit, car, tunnels corners).</li>
                <li>Once youâ€™ve gathered enough information (e.g., how many players are defending each site), regroup and execute on the weaker site.</li>
                <li>If the CTs stack one site, you can rotate to the other.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Slow play reduces the risk of walking into a stack or an ambush. It also allows you to gather information about the enemy's setup and adapt accordingly.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to B Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Divide the attention of the CTs by attacking from two directions.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with three players taking control of mid, while two players position themselves in B tunnels.</li>
                <li>Smoke CT spawn from mid to cut off rotations, and flash through mid doors as you push into B.</li>
                <li>The tunnel players should time their push with the mid players to hit B from two angles simultaneously.</li>
                <li>After securing the site, set up post-plant positions in tunnels, site, and window/door.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting B divides the attention of any CTs holding the site, making it difficult for them to defend effectively, especially with weaker weapons.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake A, Hit B</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CTs away from B and create an easier entry onto the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players towards A long with the intention of making noise and throwing utility to fake an A push.</li>
                <li>The other two players wait near B tunnels.</li>
                <li>After the A players throw their utility (smokes, flashes), they fall back, and the entire team regroups to hit B.</li>
                <li>Execute quickly onto B before the CTs can rotate back.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A well-executed fake can cause the CTs to over-rotate, leaving B under-defended.</p>
        
            <h5>Anti-Stack Play</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Avoid potential CT stacks and maintain a strong economy.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread out across the map and play cautiously, probing for information.</li>
                <li>Use utility to clear common stack spots (e.g., car on A long, B tunnels).</li>
                <li>If you detect a stack, rotate quickly to the other site or play for picks.</li>
                <li>Once youâ€™ve confirmed where the stack is not, execute onto the empty site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> By avoiding a stack, you minimize the risk of losing multiple players to a pistol eco and ensure you maintain a strong economy for future rounds.</p>

            <h4>Anti-Eco Round - CT_Side</h4>
        
            <h5>Standard 2-1-2 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain control of the map while minimizing risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play a standard 2-1-2 setup with two players on A (one long, one short), one on mid, and two on B.</li>
                <li>Play passively, holding angles from a distance where your rifles or SMGs have an advantage over pistols.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay any pushes and allow your team to rotate if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A standard setup gives you good map control while avoiding the risk of over-extending into pistols that could catch you off guard.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Long Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Secure A long early and maintain map control.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to A long with utility to secure control of the area (flashes, molotovs for car and pit).</li>
                <li>Once long is secured, leave one player to hold it while the other two rotate back to A site or mid.</li>
                <li>The other players hold mid and B passively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Securing A long gives you a strong defensive position and allows you to control one of the main entry points to the A site.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control and B Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Deny mid control and reinforce B against potential rushes.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players around mid and B (two on B site, one on mid), with the other two players on A (one long, one short).</li>
                <li>The mid player can float between mid and B, supporting wherever necessary.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay or stop any mid to B splits or straight B rushes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> This setup counters potential B rushes and mid to B splits, which are common in eco rounds.</p>
        
            <h5>A Stack with Fast Rotations</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate an A hit and rotate quickly if necessary.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on A (two long, one short) and two players on B.</li>
                <li>The long players aggressively take control of long, while the short player holds catwalk or site.</li>
                <li>The B players hold passively, ready to rotate to A or mid if needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> By stacking A and controlling long, you can effectively shut down an A push and rotate quickly if the Ts decide to hit B instead.</p>
        
            <h5>Push Tunnels or A Long for Early Information</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain early map control and information about the T setup.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Push two players into B tunnels or A long early in the round to gather information.</li>
                <li>If you encounter Ts, fall back and call for rotations.</li>
                <li>If the area is clear, you can push further to gain map control or even flank.</li>
                <li>Use the information gathered to adjust your defensive positions accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Gaining early information allows you to adjust your defense and potentially catch the Ts off guard.</p>

            <h4>Force Buy Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>B Rush with Tech-9s/MAC-10s</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use close-range weapons to overwhelm the B site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players rush B tunnels with Tech-9s, MAC-10s, or shotguns.</li>
                <li>Use flashbangs to blind any CTs holding B and push aggressively.</li>
                <li>Once you secure the site, smoke doors and molotov window to prevent a quick retake.</li>
                <li>Plant the bomb and set up close-range post-plant positions in tunnels, behind boxes, and on site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B site on Dust 2 is tight and close-quartered, making it ideal for weapons like the Tech-9 or MAC-10. A fast rush can catch the CTs off guard and overwhelm the defenders before they can react.</p>
        
            <h5>A Long Control with Utility</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of A long to open up the map.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols (Deagles, P250s) and some utility (smokes, flashes).</li>
                <li>Send three players to A long with a couple of flashbangs, while two players hold mid or short for any potential flanks.</li>
                <li>Use the flashes to take long control and push out any CTs holding pit or car.</li>
                <li>Once you have long control, decide whether to commit to an A push or rotate back to mid and catwalk for a split.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A long is a key part of the map, and controlling it can force the CTs to rotate and adjust their positions. This gives you more options for executing onto a site.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to B Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Divide the CTs' attention and take B site by surprise.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy Deagles or Scouts and send two players to B tunnels and three to mid.</li>
                <li>Smoke CT spawn from mid and use flashes to gain control of mid.</li>
                <li>The mid players push through doors into B, while the tunnel players execute onto the site simultaneously.</li>
                <li>Focus on trading kills and getting the bomb down.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The mid to B split divides the attention of the CTs and can overwhelm the B defenders, especially if theyâ€™re not expecting a fast-paced attack.</p>
        
            <h5>Catwalk Push with Utility</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Push up catwalk to A site with utility support.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols (preferably Deagles) and utility (smokes, flashes).</li>
                <li>Send all five players up catwalk, using a smoke to cover the cross and flashes to blind any CTs holding A site or short.</li>
                <li>Once on site, plant the bomb and set up crossfires and close-range positions.</li>
                <li>Post-plant, play around the bomb and use any remaining utility to delay the CTs' retake.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Pushing catwalk allows you to engage in medium-range fights where the Deagle excels. Additionally, smokes and flashes can help you safely cross and plant the bomb.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake B, Hit A</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CTs away from A and hit it with force.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players with SMGs or pistols towards B tunnels to make noise and throw some utility, simulating a B rush.</li>
                <li>The other three players wait near mid or A long.</li>
                <li>After the fake is sold, the B players fall back or die trying to create space, while the remaining three push up catwalk or long to hit A.</li>
                <li>Execute onto A with smokes and flashes, and plant the bomb.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The fake can cause CTs to rotate off A, leaving it more vulnerable to a force buy push.</p>

            <h4>Force Buy Round - CT_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Aggressive A Long Push</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Surprise the Ts with an aggressive push on A long.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols (Deagles, Five-Sevens) and some utility (flashes, smokes).</li>
                <li>Send three players to A long with a flashbang to push aggressively and take control.</li>
                <li>One player holds pit, while the other two push up or hold defensive angles.</li>
                <li>The remaining two players hold mid and B passively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> An aggressive push can catch the Ts off guard, especially if theyâ€™re not expecting CTs to contest long so heavily.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid and Short Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Control mid and short to deny T-side access to A.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy Deagles or Scouts and send two players to hold mid and catwalk.</li>
                <li>The mid player can hold from behind the doors, while the short player holds from cat or near the boxes.</li>
                <li>Use utility to slow down any T-side push and force them to fight at long range.</li>
                <li>The other three players can hold A long and B more passively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid and short denies the Ts easy access to A site and forces them to commit to a fight or rotate.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B rush and shut it down with a stack.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three or four players on B with pistols and utility.</li>
                <li>Play close angles, such as behind the big box, window, and car.</li>
                <li>Use smokes to delay any push and flashbangs to blind the Ts as they enter.</li>
                <li>The remaining player(s) can hold mid or A long to gather information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B rushes are common in force buys, and stacking the site with a well-timed crossfire can shut down the T-side push.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Push</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain control of mid and possibly get early picks.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols or SMGs and send two or three players to push mid aggressively, either through doors or lower tunnels.</li>
                <li>Use flashes to blind any Ts holding mid or top mid.</li>
                <li>After securing mid control, the players can fall back to safer positions or continue to flank and disrupt the T-side's plans.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> An aggressive mid push can catch the Ts off guard, and securing mid control gives you a lot of flexibility in terms of rotations and potential flanks.</p>
        
            <h5>A Site Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate an A push and overwhelm the Ts with numbers.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three or four players on A site, with two players holding long and the others holding catwalk or on site.</li>
                <li>Use smokes to block vision and flashbangs to blind any Ts pushing long or cat.</li>
                <li>Hold close angles where pistols can be most effective.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> If the Ts commit to an A push, your stack can overwhelm them, especially with pistols at close range.</p>

            <h4>Full Buy Round - T_Side Strategies</h4>
            
            <h5>Default Spread</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain map control, gather information, and adapt based on the CT setup.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to A long, one to mid, and two to B tunnels.</li>
                <li>The A long players should carefully take control of long with utility, while the mid player looks for any aggression from the CTs.</li>
                <li>The B tunnel players should control tunnels and look for any pushes from the CTs.</li>
                <li>After gathering information, the team can decide to execute on A, B, or mid, depending on where the CTs are weakest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A default spread allows you to take control of key areas of the map while being flexible enough to react to the CTâ€™s movements.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to B Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Split the B site from two directions, overwhelming the defenders.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with two players in B tunnels and three players taking control of mid.</li>
                <li>Smoke CT spawn to block off rotations and use flashes to push through mid doors.</li>
                <li>The mid players push through to B from mid doors, while the tunnel players execute onto the site simultaneously.</li>
                <li>Focus on trading kills and securing the B site.</li>
                <li>Once the bomb is planted, set up strong post-plant positions in tunnels, site, and window/door.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting B divides the attention of the CTs, making it harder for them to defend against a coordinated push from two directions.</p>
        
            <h5>Catwalk Execute</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of catwalk and execute onto A site with utility.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send four players up catwalk and one player to hold mid or lurk A long.</li>
                <li>Use a smoke to cover the CT spawn and flash over catwalk to blind any CTs holding A site or short.</li>
                <li>As you push up catwalk, use molotovs to clear common positions (e.g., goose, ramp) and smokes to block off CT spawn and deep site.</li>
                <li>Plant the bomb and set up post-plant positions on catwalk, site, and long if possible.</li>
                <li>The mid player can apply pressure or assist by holding rotations through CT spawn or mid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A well-executed catwalk push can overwhelm the A defenders, especially with good utility usage to cover the cross and clear positions.</p>
        
            <h5>A Long Control into A Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of A long and split the A site with players coming from catwalk.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to A long and two to catwalk.</li>
                <li>The long players should use utility (flashes, smokes) to take control of long, pushing any CTs back to site or CT spawn.</li>
                <li>Once you have long control, the catwalk players push up and execute onto A with the long players.</li>
                <li>Smoke off CT spawn and use molotovs to clear common positions (goose, site).</li>
                <li>Plant the bomb and set up crossfires between long and catwalk.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting the A site from long and catwalk forces the CTs to defend from multiple angles, making it difficult for them to hold the site effectively.</p>
        
            <h5>B Rush</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Overwhelm the B site with speed and numbers.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players rush B tunnels with full utility (smokes, flashes, molotovs).</li>
                <li>Use flashbangs to blind any CTs holding B and push aggressively onto the site.</li>
                <li>Smoke the doors and molotov window to secure the site and prevent a quick retake.</li>
                <li>Once the site is secured, plant the bomb and set up post-plant positions in tunnels, on site, and window/door.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A fast B rush with proper utility can catch the B defenders off guard and secure the site before the CTs have time to rotate.</p>

            <h4>Full Buy Round - CT_Side Strategies</h4>
            
            <h5>Standard 2-1-2 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain balanced control of the map with the ability to quickly rotate.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play two players on A (one long, one short), one player on mid, and two players on B.</li>
                <li>The A long player can start with a deep smoke or flash to take long control, while the short player holds from ramp or site.</li>
                <li>The mid player should hold mid doors, ready to rotate to B or A as needed.</li>
                <li>The B players hold site and tunnels, using utility to delay any push and potentially peeking mid for information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A standard setup allows for good map control and the ability to rotate quickly based on where the T-side decides to push.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive A Long Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of A long early and deny the T-side access to this key area.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two or three players to A long with utility (flashes, smokes) to contest long control.</li>
                <li>One player holds pit or car, while the others push up to contest any T-side presence.</li>
                <li>If you secure long, leave one player to hold it while the others rotate back to A site or mid.</li>
                <li>The remaining players can hold mid and B passively, ready to rotate if needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling A long gives you a strong defensive position and denies the T-side a crucial entry point to the A site.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid and Catwalk Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Deny the T-side control of mid and catwalk, forcing them into tougher engagements.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play one player aggressively on catwalk and one player holding mid.</li>
                <li>The catwalk player can start with a molotov or smoke to block off the push and then hold from a safe position.</li>
                <li>The mid player can hold from behind the doors or from window/CT to prevent any mid control.</li>
                <li>The other three players hold A long and B site, ready to rotate based on the T-side's movement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Denying mid and catwalk control forces the T-side to either commit to A long or attempt a difficult mid-to-B split.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack with Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B push and reinforce the site while maintaining mid control.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play three players on B (one on site, one in tunnels, and one holding mid).</li>
                <li>The mid player should focus on controlling mid and helping with any mid-to-B splits.</li>
                <li>The B site players hold close angles with utility to delay any rush and prepare to trade kills.</li>
                <li>The remaining two players hold A site, ready to rotate quickly if needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B stacks can completely shut down a T-side B rush, especially with the added support from mid.</p>
        
            <h5>Double AWP Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use AWPs to control long-range engagements and deny the T-side key areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>One AWP player holds A long, peeking from car or corner to pick off any Ts trying to take long control.</li>
                <li>The second AWP holds mid or B, focusing on picking any T-side players trying to cross or push mid.</li>
                <li>The remaining players hold A short and B site, using utility to support the AWPers and deny map control.</li>
                <li>Rotate quickly based on where the AWPs spot the T-side.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Double AWP setups can be incredibly powerful on Dust 2, where long-range sightlines dominate. It allows you to control key areas of the map and force the T-side into difficult engagements.</p>
