            <h3>Anti-Eco Round</h3>
            <p>Youâ€™re playing against opponents who likely have little to no armor and weaker weapons, such as pistols or SMGs. 
                The primary goal is to minimize risk, maintain your economy, and avoid giving away any weapons to the enemy.

            <h3>Force Buy Round</h3>
            <p>Force buys are rounds where your team spends most of its remaining money on weapons, armor, and utility, despite not having enough for a full buy. 
                The goal in a force buy is to make the most of what you have and try to secure a round win or at least do economic damage to the enemy.

            <h3>Full Buy Round</h3>
            <p>Full buy rounds are where both teams are fully equipped with rifles, full armor, and utility. 
                These rounds are often the most tactical and crucial in a match, as both teams have all the resources needed to execute complex strategies.

            <h4>Pistol Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Fast A Execute</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Overwhelm the A site with speed and numbers.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players rush A through A ramp and palace.</li>
                <li>Use flashbangs to blind any CTs holding close or on site.</li>
                <li>Push onto the site, plant the bomb, and set up post-plant positions in palace, ramp, and site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A fast A execute can catch the CTs off guard, especially if they are not fully set up with utility.</p>
        
            <h5>B Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Attack the B site from both B apartments and catwalk.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players through B apartments and two through mid to catwalk.</li>
                <li>The mid players should smoke off connector and short, then push catwalk.</li>
                <li>The B apartments players push onto the site simultaneously, focusing on trading kills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting B from catwalk and apartments divides the CTs' attention, making it harder for them to defend effectively.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid to open up the map for later executes.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to take mid control, using smokes to cover window and connector.</li>
                <li>One player holds top mid, one pushes catwalk, and one watches underpass.</li>
                <li>Once mid control is secured, decide whether to push through connector to A or catwalk to B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Mid control on Mirage is crucial as it forces the CTs to rotate and adapt, giving your team multiple options for site execution.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake B, Hit A</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw rotations away from A and execute onto A.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to make noise and throw utility towards B apartments, simulating a B hit.</li>
                <li>The remaining three players wait near A ramp and palace.</li>
                <li>After selling the fake, the B players fall back, and the entire team executes onto A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A well-executed fake can cause the CTs to over-rotate, leaving A site less defended.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="pistol-ct-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">
            <h4>Pistol Round - CT_Side</h4>
        
            <h5>Standard 2-1-2 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Cover all areas of the map with a balanced defense.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play two players on A (one holding ramp, one holding palace), one mid, and two on B (one apartments, one short/catwalk).</li>
                <li>The A players should delay the push with utility, the mid player contests mid control or assists either site, and the B players are ready to defend or rotate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> This setup provides good coverage and allows for quick rotations based on T-side movements.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid early to deny the Ts access to key areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to push mid aggressively, using utility to smoke off top mid and molotov underpass.</li>
                <li>One player holds A, and two players hold B passively.</li>
                <li>Use the mid control to apply pressure or rotate to either bombsite as needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid early on Mirage gives your team flexibility and can deny the Ts access to critical parts of the map.</p>
        
            <h5>A Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate an A push and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on A (one ramp, one palace, one connector) with two players on B.</li>
                <li>The A players should use utility to delay any push and hold strong defensive positions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A stack can overwhelm the Ts if they commit to A, allowing your team to trade favorably and potentially win the round.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B rush and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on B (one apartments, one site, one short/catwalk) with two players on A.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashes to delay any push and hold close angles where pistols are effective.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B stacks can shut down a T-side B rush, especially if the Ts are not expecting a heavy defense.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive A Ramp Push</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain control of A ramp early to deny the Ts easy access to the A site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to push A ramp aggressively, using utility (flashbangs, molotovs) to take control of the area.</li>
                <li>One player holds palace, and the remaining two players hold mid and B passively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> An aggressive push on A ramp can catch the Ts off guard and deny them a crucial entry point to the A site.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="anti-eco-t-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">
            <h4>Anti-Eco Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Group and Push Together (A or B)</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use superior firepower to overwhelm a bombsite.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Push:</strong> All five players push A together, using utility to clear angles and force the CTs back. Once the site is secured, plant the bomb and hold post-plant positions.</li>
                <li><strong>B Push:</strong> Similarly, all five players rush B together through B apartments, using flashbangs to blind any close CTs and quickly take control of the site. Smoke off key positions and molotov common hiding spots.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Grouping up reduces the chances of being picked off individually and allows for effective trading.</p>
        
            <h5>Slow Play with Map Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of key areas slowly to avoid ambushes.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to mid, one to A ramp, and two to B apartments.</li>
                <li>Carefully clear out common stack spots using utility.</li>
                <li>Once youâ€™ve gathered information on the CT setup, execute onto the weaker site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Slow, methodical play helps avoid walking into eco traps and allows you to react based on the CT setup.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Control mid to cut off rotations and split towards a bombsite.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take control of mid with three players, while two players hold A ramp or B apartments.</li>
                <li>Once mid control is secured, split towards the weaker site, either through connector to A or catwalk to B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid gives you options to execute onto either site while cutting off CT rotations.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake A, Hit B</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CT rotations away from B and execute onto B.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to make noise at A with utility, while two players hold B apartments.</li>
                <li>After selling the fake, regroup and hit B before the CTs can rotate back.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A well-executed fake can draw defenders away from the actual target, making it easier to secure the site.</p>
        
            <h5>Anti-Stack Play</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Avoid potential CT stacks and maintain a strong economy.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread out across the map and play cautiously.</li>
                <li>Use utility to clear common stack spots and probe for information.</li>
                <li>If a stack is detected, rotate to the other site or play for picks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Avoiding a stack minimizes the risk of losing multiple players to a pistol eco and ensures a safer round.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="anti-eco-ct-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">     
            <h4>Anti-Eco Round - CT_Side</h4>
        
            <h5>Standard 2-1-2 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain control of the map while minimizing risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play two players on A, one mid, and two on B.</li>
                <li>Hold angles from a distance where rifles and SMGs can engage pistols at a safe range.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay pushes and gather information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A standard setup gives you good coverage while avoiding over-extending into potential pistol pushes.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid to deny T-side access.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to aggressively control mid, with one holding A and two holding B passively.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashes to block vision and take control of mid, denying the Ts access to key areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Mid control is crucial on Mirage and can prevent the Ts from executing effective splits.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack with Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B push and reinforce the site while maintaining mid control.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on B (one apartments, one site, one catwalk) with two on A.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay any rush and hold strong angles where rifles can shine.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B stacks can completely shut down a T-side rush, especially with mid control cutting off rotations.</p>
        
            <h5>A Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate an A hit and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on A (one ramp, one palace, one connector) with two players on B.</li>
                <li>Use smokes to block vision and flashbangs to blind any Ts pushing A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> If the Ts commit to A, your stack can overwhelm them with superior firepower and numbers.</p>
        
            <h5>Push for Early Information</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain early map control and gather information about the T setup.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Push two players into mid or B apartments to gather early information.</li>
                <li>If you encounter resistance, fall back and adjust your defense accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Gaining early information allows you to adapt your defense and potentially catch the Ts off guard.</p>

        <div id="force-buy-t-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">
            <h4>Force Buy Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>B Rush with Tech-9s/MAC-10s</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use close-range weapons to overwhelm the B site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players rush B apartments with Tech-9s, MAC-10s, or shotguns.</li>
                <li>Use flashbangs to blind any CTs holding B apartments or site and push aggressively.</li>
                <li>Once you secure the site, smoke off catwalk and market, and plant the bomb.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B site on Mirage has tight corners, making it ideal for close-range weapons in a fast rush.</p>
        
            <h5>A Execute with Utility</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of the A site using pistols and utility.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols (Deagles, P250s) and some utility (smokes, flashes).</li>
                <li>Send two players through A ramp and three through palace.</li>
                <li>Use smokes to cover CT spawn and jungle, and flashes to blind any CTs holding site or close angles.</li>
                <li>Push onto the site, focusing on trading kills and getting the bomb down.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Properly timed utility can neutralize the CTs' defense and allow your team to take control of the A site.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to A Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Split the A site from mid and A ramp/palace.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to take mid control and two players to A ramp or palace.</li>
                <li>The mid players should smoke off connector and push through to jungle or window, while the A players execute onto the site.</li>
                <li>Focus on trading kills and securing control of A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting the A site from multiple directions divides the CTs' attention, making it harder for them to defend effectively.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control with a Lurk</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Control mid and create an opening for a site hit.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols or SMGs and send three players to take mid control, while one player lurks at B apartments and the other at A.</li>
                <li>Use utility to smoke off key areas like window and connector.</li>
                <li>After taking mid control, the lurkers can apply pressure to the sites, making it easier to decide where to execute.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Mid control gives you options to hit either site and forces the CTs to spread out, making it easier to find openings.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake B, Hit A</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CTs away from A and hit it with force.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players with SMGs or pistols to B apartments to make noise and throw utility.</li>
                <li>The remaining three players wait near A ramp and palace.</li>
                <li>After the fake, regroup and hit A, taking advantage of any rotations the CTs might have made.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The fake can cause the CTs to over-rotate, leaving A more vulnerable to a force buy push.</p>

            <h4>Force Buy Round - CT_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain control of mid and potentially get early picks.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols or SMGs and send two or three players to push mid aggressively.</li>
                <li>Use flashes to blind any Ts holding mid or top mid.</li>
                <li>After securing mid control, either fall back to safer positions or continue to flank and disrupt the T-side's plans.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> An aggressive mid push can catch the Ts off guard, and controlling mid gives you flexibility in rotations and flanks.</p>
        
            <h5>A Ramp Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of A ramp early and deny the Ts access.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols or SMGs and send two players to A ramp with utility to take control.</li>
                <li>One player holds close ramp, while the other supports from connector or jungle.</li>
                <li>The remaining players hold mid and B passively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> An aggressive push on A ramp can catch the Ts off guard and deny them control of a key area.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B rush and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three or four players on B with pistols and utility.</li>
                <li>Play close angles in B apartments and on site.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashbangs to delay the push and engage the Ts at close range.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B rushes are common in force buys, and stacking the site with close-range weapons can shut down the T-side's push.</p>
        
            <h5>A Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate an A push and overwhelm the Ts with numbers.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three or four players on A site, with two holding A ramp and the others in palace or connector.</li>
                <li>Use utility to block vision and flashbangs to blind any Ts pushing A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> If the Ts commit to A, your stack can overwhelm them with superior numbers and close-range weapons.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Control mid and force the Ts into tougher engagements.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play two players aggressively in mid, with one holding window or connector and one floating between A and B.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashes to block off key areas and hold strong angles.</li>
                <li>The remaining players can hold A and B passively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid denies the Ts easy access to either site and forces them into more predictable paths.</p>

            <h4>Full Buy Round - T_Side Strategies</h4>
            
            <h5>Default Spread</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain map control, gather information, and adapt based on the CT setup.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to A ramp and palace, one to mid, and two to B apartments.</li>
                <li>The A players should carefully take control using utility, while the mid player looks for aggression and the B players hold for any pushes.</li>
                <li>After gathering information, decide whether to execute on A, B, or mid, depending on where the CTs are weakest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A default spread allows you to control key areas of the map while being flexible enough to react to the CTâ€™s movements.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to A Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Split the A site from mid and A ramp/palace.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to take mid control and two players to A ramp or palace.</li>
                <li>The mid players should smoke off connector and push through to jungle or window, while the A players execute onto the site.</li>
                <li>Focus on trading kills and securing control of A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting the A site from multiple directions divides the CTs' attention, making it harder for them to defend effectively.</p>
        
            <h5>B Execute</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Overwhelm the B site with a coordinated execute.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players set up for a B execute, using smokes, flashes, and molotovs to clear out key positions.</li>
                <li>Smoke off catwalk and market, and use molotovs to flush out any CTs hiding in common spots.</li>
                <li>Push onto the site and plant the bomb.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A well-executed B hit with proper utility can overwhelm the B defenders, especially if theyâ€™re not expecting a fast-paced attack.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake A, Hit B</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CTs away from B and hit it with force.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to A ramp and palace to make noise and throw utility, simulating an A hit.</li>
                <li>The other two players wait near B apartments.</li>
                <li>After the fake, the A players fall back, and the entire team hits B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A fake can cause the CTs to over-rotate, leaving B under-defended.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control into Split B</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take mid control and split B site from mid and B apartments.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to mid and two to B apartments.</li>
                <li>Use utility to smoke off window and connector while taking control of catwalk.</li>
                <li>The mid players push catwalk while the B apartments players execute onto the site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A mid-to-B split divides the CTs' attention, making it harder for them to effectively defend the B site.</p>

        <div id="full-buy-ct-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">
            <h4>Full Buy Round - CT_Side Strategies</h4>
            
            <h5>Standard 2-1-2 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain balanced control of the map with the ability to rotate quickly.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play two players on A, one mid, and two on B.</li>
                <li>The A players should control ramp, palace, and connector, the mid player controls rotations and assists A or B as needed, and the B players hold apartments and catwalk.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A standard setup allows for good map control and the ability to rotate quickly based on where the T-side decides to push.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid early to deny the T-side access to key areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to aggressively control mid, with one holding A and two holding B.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashes to block vision and engage the Ts in mid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid on Mirage is crucial, as it denies the Ts access to critical parts of the map and forces them into more predictable paths.</p>
        
            <h5>A Site Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of A ramp and palace early to deny the T-side access to the A site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to control A ramp and one player to control palace.</li>
                <li>Use utility (smokes, molotovs) to block key areas like Tetris and balcony.</li>
                <li>The remaining players hold mid and B passively, ready to rotate if needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling A ramp and palace gives you a strong defensive position and denies the T-side a crucial entry point to the A site.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack with Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B push and reinforce the site while maintaining mid control.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play three players on B (one apartments, one site, one catwalk) and two on A.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay any push and hold close angles on B site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B stacks can completely shut down a T-side B rush, especially with mid control cutting off rotations.</p>
        
            <h5>Double AWP Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use AWPs to control long-range engagements and deny the T-side key areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>One AWP player holds mid, peeking from window or connector to pick off any Ts trying to take control.</li>
                <li>The second AWP holds B apartments or A ramp, focusing on picking any T-side players trying to push B or A.</li>
                <li>The remaining players hold A and B site, using utility to support the AWPers and deny map control.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Double AWP setups can be incredibly powerful on Mirage, where long-range sightlines dominate, allowing you to control key areas of the map and force the T-side into difficult engagements.</p>
