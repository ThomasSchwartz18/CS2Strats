            <h3>Pistol Round</h3>
            <p>The key to success is communication, coordination, and adapting based on the enemy team's tendencies and your own team's strengths.</p>

            <h3>Anti-Eco Round</h3>
            <p>You're playing against opponents who likely have little to no armor and weaker weapons, such as pistols or SMGs. 
                The primary goal is to minimize risk, maintain your economy, and avoid giving away any weapons to the enemy.

            <h3>Force Buy Round</h3>
            <p>Force buys are rounds where your team spends most of its remaining money on weapons, armor, and utility, despite not having enough for a full buy. 
                The goal in a force buy is to make the most of what you have and try to secure a round win or at least do economic damage to the enemy.

            <h3>Full Buy Round</h3>
            <p>Full buy rounds are where both teams are fully equipped with rifles (usually AK-47s for Ts and M4s for CTs), full armor, and utility (smokes, flashes, molotovs, and HE grenades). 
                These rounds are often the most tactical and crucial in a match, as both teams have all the resources needed to execute complex strategies.

            <h4>Pistol Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Fast A Execute</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Overwhelm the A site with speed and numbers.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fast smoke red room for mid players.</li>
                <li>mid players molly back donut and push in.</li>
                <li>All five players rush through A main and A donut.</li>
                <li>Use flashbangs to blind any CTs holding close in A donut or on site.</li>
                <li>Push onto the A site, plant the bomb, and set up post-plant positions in cave, site, and temple.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Fast A pushes are difficult to defend on pistol rounds, especially if the CTs are not stacked on the site.</p>
        
            <h5>B Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Split the B site from two directions (ramp and mid).</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players through B ramp and two through mid.</li>
                <li>The mid players should take control of mid, smoking off donut and flashing through Cave.</li>
                <li>The B ramp players push onto the site simultaneously, focusing on trading kills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A split attack divides the attention of the CTs, making it harder for them to hold the site.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="pistol-ct-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">

            <h4>Pistol Round - CT_Side</h4>
        
            <h5>Standard 2-1-2 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Cover all areas of the map with balanced defense.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play two players on A (one in A main, one in temple), one mid, and two on B (one site, one ramp).</li>
                <li>The A players should focus on delaying and holding the push, the mid player controls rotations and assists A or B as needed, and the B players should be ready to hold ramp or site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> This setup provides good coverage across the map and allows for quick rotations.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid early to prevent a T-side split.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to push mid aggressively with flashes and smokes.</li>
                <li>One player holds A, and two hold B passively.</li>
                <li>Use utility to block vision and engage the Ts in mid, potentially cutting off their routes to A or B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid on Ancient is crucial, as it denies the Ts access to critical parts of the map.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="anti-eco-t-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">
            <button href="#" onclick="showSidePage('anti-eco-t-side')">T_Side</button>
            <button href="#" onclick="showSidePage('anti-eco-ct-side')">CT_Side</button>
            <h4>Anti-Eco Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Group and Push Together (A or B)</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use superior firepower to overwhelm a bombsite.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Push:</strong> All five players group up and push A main and donut together, using utility to clear angles and force the CTs back. Once the site is secured, plant the bomb and hold post-plant positions.</li>
                <li><strong>B Push:</strong> Similar to A, all five players rush B ramp, using flashbangs to blind any close CTs and quickly take control of the site. Smoke off cave, long, short and molotov the common hiding spots.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Grouping up reduces the chances of being picked off individually and allows for effective trading.</p>
        
            <h5>Slow Play with Map Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of key areas slowly to avoid any ambushes.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to A, one mid, and two to B.</li>
                <li>Carefully clear out common stack spots using utility.</li>
                <li>Once you have information on where the CTs are stacking, execute onto the opposite site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Slow, methodical play helps avoid walking into eco traps and allows you to react based on the CT setup.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Control mid to cut off rotations and split towards a bombsite.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take control of mid with three players, while two players hold A or B.</li>
                <li>Once mid control is secured, split towards the weaker site, either through donut to A or B connectors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid gives you options to execute onto either site while cutting off CT rotations.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake A, Hit B</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CT rotations away from B and hit it with force.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to make noise at A with utility, while two players hold B.</li>
                <li>After the fake, regroup and hit B before the CTs can rotate back.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A well-executed fake can draw defenders away from the actual target, making it easier to secure the site.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="anti-eco-ct-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">

            <button href="#" onclick="showSidePage('anti-eco-ct-side')">CT_Side</button>
            <h4>Anti-Eco Round - CT_Side</h4>
        
            <h5>Standard 2-1-2 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain control of the map while minimizing risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play two players on A, one mid, and two on B.</li>
                <li>Hold angles from a distance where rifles and SMGs can engage pistols at a safe range.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay pushes and gather information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A standard setup gives you good coverage while avoiding over-extending into potential pistol pushes.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid to deny T-side access.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to aggressively control mid, with one holding A and two holding B passively.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashes to block vision and take control of mid, denying the Ts access to key areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Mid control is crucial on Ancient and can prevent the Ts from executing effective splits.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack with Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B push and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on B (one ramp, one site, one holding mid) with two on A.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay any rush and hold strong angles where rifles can shine.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B stacks can completely shut down a T-side rush, especially with mid control cutting off rotations.</p>
        
            <h5>A Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate an A hit and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three players on A (one in A main, one temple, one donut) and two players on B.</li>
                <li>Use smokes to block vision and flashbangs to blind any Ts pushing A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> If the Ts commit to A, your stack can overwhelm them with superior firepower and numbers.</p>

        <div id="force-buy-t-side" class="dust2-subpage hidden">
            <button href="#" onclick="showSidePage('force-buy-t-side')">T_Side</button>
            <button href="#" onclick="showSidePage('force-buy-ct-side')">CT_Side</button>
            <h4>Force Buy Round - T_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>B Rush with Tech-9s/MAC-10s</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use close-range weapons to overwhelm the B site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players rush B ramp with Tech-9s, MAC-10s, or shotguns.</li>
                <li>Use flashbangs to blind any CTs holding B and push aggressively.</li>
                <li>Once you secure the site, smoke off the connectors and molotov common hiding spots.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B site on Ancient is narrow and favors close-range weapons, making it ideal for a fast rush.</p>
        
            <h5>A Main Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of A main and push onto A site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols (Deagles, P250s) and some utility (smokes, flashes).</li>
                <li>Send three players to A main with flashes to clear angles, while two players hold mid or B for any potential flanks.</li>
                <li>Once you have A main control, execute onto A site, using smokes to block off temple and molotov to clear site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling A main opens up the A site, forcing the CTs to either contest or rotate.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to B Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Split the B site from two directions, overwhelming the defenders.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to B ramp and three players to mid.</li>
                <li>Smoke off the B connectors and flash through mid to take control.</li>
                <li>The mid players push through to B, while the ramp players execute onto the site simultaneously.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The split attack divides the attention of the CTs and can overwhelm the B defenders.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid Control with a Lurk</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Control mid and create an opening for a site hit.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols or SMGs and send three players to take mid control, while one player lurks at B and the other at A.</li>
                <li>Use utility to smoke off key areas like donut and molotov common positions.</li>
                <li>After taking mid control, the lurkers can apply pressure to the sites, making it easier to decide where to execute.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Mid control gives you options to hit either site and forces the CTs to spread out, making it easier to find openings.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake B, Hit A</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CTs away from A and hit it with force.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players with SMGs or pistols to B ramp to make noise and throw utility.</li>
                <li>The remaining three players wait near A main.</li>
                <li>After the fake, regroup and hit A, taking advantage of any rotations the CTs might have made.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The fake can cause the CTs to over-rotate, leaving A more vulnerable to a force buy push.</p>

            <h4>Force Buy Round - CT_Side</h4>
            
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Push</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain control of mid and potentially get early picks.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols or SMGs and send two or three players to push mid aggressively.</li>
                <li>Use flashes to blind any Ts holding mid or ledge.</li>
                <li>After securing mid control, either fall back to safer positions or continue to flank and disrupt the T-side's plans.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> An aggressive mid push can catch the Ts off guard, and controlling mid gives you flexibility in rotations and flanks.</p>
        
            <h5>A Main Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of A main early and deny the Ts access.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy pistols or SMGs and send three players to A main with a flashbang to push aggressively.</li>
                <li>One player holds temple, while the other two push into A main or donut.</li>
                <li>The remaining players hold mid or B passively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> An aggressive push can catch the Ts off guard and deny them control of A main, a critical area for executing onto A site.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B rush and reinforce the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three or four players on B with pistols and utility.</li>
                <li>Play close angles on B ramp and site.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashbangs to delay the push and engage the Ts at close range.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B rushes are common in force buys, and stacking the site with close-range weapons can shut down the T-side's push.</p>
        
            <h5>A Stack</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate an A push and overwhelm the Ts with numbers.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack three or four players on A site, with two holding A main and the others in temple or donut.</li>
                <li>Use utility to block vision and flashbangs to blind any Ts pushing A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> If the Ts commit to an A push, your stack can overwhelm them with superior numbers and close-range weapons.</p>

            <h4>Full Buy Round - T_Side Strategies</h4>
            
            <h5>Default Spread</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain map control, gather information, and adapt based on the CT setup.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to A main, one to mid, and two to B ramp.</li>
                <li>The A main players carefully take control using utility, while the mid player looks for aggression and the B ramp players hold for any pushes.</li>
                <li>After gathering information, decide whether to execute on A, B, or mid, depending on where the CTs are weakest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A default spread allows you to control key areas of the map while being flexible enough to react to the CT’s movements.</p>
        
            <h5>Mid to B Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Split the B site from two directions, overwhelming the defenders.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with two players at B ramp and three players taking mid control.</li>
                <li>Smoke off B connectors and use flashes to push through mid.</li>
                <li>The mid players push through to B, while the B ramp players execute onto the site simultaneously.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting B divides the attention of the CTs, making it harder for them to defend against a coordinated push.</p>
        
            <h5>A Main Control into A Split</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of A main and split the A site with players coming from mid.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to A main and three to mid.</li>
                <li>The A main players use utility (smokes, flashes) to take control of A main and force CTs back.</li>
                <li>The mid players take control and push through donut or ledge to split onto A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Splitting the A site from A main and mid forces the CTs to defend from multiple angles, making it difficult for them to hold the site.</p>
        
            <h5>B Execute</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Overwhelm the B site with a coordinated execute.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All five players set up for a B execute, using smokes, flashes, and molotovs to clear out key positions.</li>
                <li>Smoke off the B connectors and use molotovs to flush out any CTs hiding in common spots.</li>
                <li>Push onto the site and plant the bomb.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A well-executed B hit with proper utility can overwhelm the B defenders, especially if they’re not expecting a fast-paced attack.</p>
        
            <h5>Fake A, Hit B</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw CTs away from B and hit it with force.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send three players to A main to make noise and throw utility, simulating an A hit.</li>
                <li>The other two players wait near B ramp.</li>
                <li>After the fake, the A players fall back, and the entire team hits B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A fake can cause the CTs to over-rotate, leaving B under-defended.</p>

            <h4>Full Buy Round - CT_Side Strategies</h4>
            
            <h5>Standard 2-1-2 Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain balanced control of the map with the ability to rotate quickly.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play two players on A, one mid, and two on B.</li>
                <li>The A players should control A main and temple, the mid player controls rotations and assists A or B as needed, and the B players hold ramp and site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> A standard setup allows for good map control and the ability to rotate quickly based on where the T-side decides to push.</p>
        
            <h5>Aggressive Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of mid early to deny the T-side access to key areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two players to aggressively control mid, with one holding A and two holding B.</li>
                <li>Use smokes and flashes to block vision and engage the Ts in mid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling mid on Ancient is crucial, as it denies the Ts access to critical parts of the map and forces them into more predictable paths.</p>
        
            <h5>A Long Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Take control of A main early and deny the T-side access to this key area.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send two or three players to A main with utility (flashes, smokes) to contest control.</li>
                <li>One player holds temple or donut, while the others push into A main or hold defensive angles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Controlling A main gives you a strong defensive position and denies the T-side a crucial entry point to the A site.</p>
        
            <h5>B Stack with Mid Control</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Anticipate a B push and reinforce the site while maintaining mid control.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play three players on B (one ramp, one site, one holding mid) and two on A.</li>
                <li>Use utility to delay any push and hold close angles on B ramp and site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> B stacks can completely shut down a T-side B rush, especially with mid control cutting off rotations.</p>
        
            <h5>Double AWP Setup</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use AWPs to control long-range engagements and deny the T-side key areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>One AWP player holds A main, peeking from temple or donut to pick off any Ts trying to take control.</li>
                <li>The second AWP holds mid or B, focusing on picking any T-side players trying to push mid or B ramp.</li>
                <li>The remaining players hold A site and B site, using utility to support the AWPers and deny map control.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Double AWP setups can be incredibly powerful on Ancient, where long-range sightlines dominate, allowing you to control key areas of the map and force the T-side into difficult engagements.</p>
